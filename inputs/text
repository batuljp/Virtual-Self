Albert Einstein once said.

Everybody's a genius, 

But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree,

It will live it's whole life believing,

That it is stupid.

We have Modern-day schooling that not only makes fish climb trees, 

But also makes them climb down and do it 10-mile run.

I must ask do you prepare students for the future or the past?

I myself am no Gandhi, but today,

We don't need to make robots or zombies. 

The world has progressed and now we need people who think creatively, innovatively, critically, independently, with the ability to connect.

Every scientist will tell you that no two brains are the same and every parent with two or more children will confirm that claim.

If a doctor prescribed the exact same medicine to all of his patients,

The results will be tragic. 

So many people would get sick yet when it comes to school, This is exactly what happens.

It's a shame.

We need to make a world where fish are no longer forced to climb trees.

I rest my case.
